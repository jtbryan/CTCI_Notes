 * How hiring is determined can vary by company
    * In some companies, interviewers come together to determine your overall performance and come to a conclusion
    * In other companies, interviewers solely provide feedback and recommendations to hiring commitees and hiring managers to make the final decision

* If you have not heard anything back in a week you should follow-up with the recruiter 

* **Befriend your recruiter**, they can be an essential asset in getting you through the process or even advocating for you if you performed poorly

## Microsoft Interview

* Microsoft wants smart people, and while you won't be tested on C++ API's, expect to write code.

* Easy questions may be presented initially to ease you into the comfort of the interview process

* If you meet with a hiring manager it likely means you passed the interview with a particular team

* Be prepared to answer **Why do you want to work at Microsoft?** 
    * This is an important question as it shows your passions for technology as well as your interest in Microsoft products
    * An example approach may be to discuss your passions or interest regardng Visual Studio and why you like it
